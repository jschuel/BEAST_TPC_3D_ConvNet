# BEAST_TPC_3D_ConvNet
Example repository containing data processing and analysis tools for event classification and directional assignment of TPC recoil events using 3D convolutional neural networks. We include sample data, a sample trained model, files for the network architecture, custom PyTorch DataLoader classes, and a training/evaluation script.
